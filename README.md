# Port_Scanner

## Why I built this
I wanted a small C++ project to better understand how basic networking works at a low level.
This project helped me learn how TCP connections are established and how tools can check
whether a service is reachable on a given port.

## What I learned
- Basic socket programming using Winsock
- How TCP connection attempts can be used for port scanning
- Writing a simple command-line tool in C++
- Handling errors and timeouts in network code

## Limitations
This is a simple educational project and does not aim to replace professional scanning tools.
It was intentionally kept small to focus on learning the core concepts.
